== Features ==

=== Core Functionality ===
* '''Bidirectional Link Traversal''': Explores both outbound links (FROM articles) and inbound links (TO articles)
* '''Real-time Graph Building''': Starts with a root article and progressively builds the network
* '''Smart Context Menu''': Right-click-style menu with options to expand, collapse, open, or set as root
* '''Priority-Based Crawling''': Prioritizes Vital articles (3000), Featured articles (2000), Good articles (1000), and articles by backlink count
* '''Link Validation''': Checks page existence to handle broken Wikipedia links

=== Visual Design ===
* '''Obsidian-style Dark Theme''': Clean, modern interface optimized for graph exploration
* '''Color-coded Nodes''':
** ‚ö™ '''White''': Root article (starting point) with green border
** üü° '''Gold''': Vital articles (highest priority, larger size)
** üü¢ '''Green''': Featured articles (high priority)
** üîµ '''Light Blue''': Good articles (medium priority)
** üîµ '''Blue/Teal''': Regular Wikipedia articles (1st/2nd degree)
** üî¥ '''Red''': Missing/non-existent pages (red links)
** üü° '''Yellow Border''': Expandable nodes with pulsing animation
* '''Force-directed Layout''': Natural node positioning with physics simulation
* '''Zoom & Pan''': Navigate large graphs with mouse controls

=== Interaction ===
* '''Click''': Show context menu with multiple options
* '''Context Menu Options''':
** üîó '''Open Wikipedia Page''': Opens article in new tab
** üîÑ '''Collapse''': Removes leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection)
** ‚ûï '''Expand''': Reveals 10 more inbound + 10 outbound links
** üéØ '''Set as Root''': Makes the selected node the new root of the graph
* '''Drag''': Move nodes around the canvas
* '''Scroll''': Zoom in/out of the graph

== Technical Architecture ==

=== API Integration ===
* Uses Wikipedia REST API for article links and backlinks
* Fetches article categories and metadata for quality assessment
* Implements proper error handling and rate limiting
* Filters out non-article links (categories, templates, files)
* Validates page existence before adding to graph

=== Graph Management ===
* '''Node Deduplication''': Prevents duplicate articles in the network
* '''Link Direction''': Maintains proper directional relationships
* '''Expansion Tracking''': Prevents re-expansion of already processed nodes
* '''Priority Queue''': Processes high-quality articles first (Vital > Featured > Good > Backlink count)
* '''Context Menu''': Smart menu system with disabled states for unavailable actions
* '''Memory Efficient''': Limits link counts to prevent browser overload

=== Performance ===
* '''Lazy Loading''': Only fetches data when needed
* '''Batch Processing''': Processes multiple links efficiently
* '''Visual Feedback''': Shows loading states and progress indicators
* '''Responsive Design''': Adapts to different screen sizes

== Usage ==

# '''Start''': Open <code>index.html</code> in a web browser
# '''Explore''': The graph begins with "Artificial Intelligence" as the root
# '''Interact''': Click any node to open the context menu with options:
#* Open Wikipedia page in new tab
#* Expand node with 10 more connected articles
#* Collapse node by removing leaf connections
#* Set node as new root for the graph
# '''Navigate''': Use mouse to zoom, pan, and drag nodes
# '''Prioritization''': High-quality articles (Vital/Featured/Good) are processed first

== Configuration ==

=== Default Settings ===
* '''Root Article''': "Artificial_intelligence"
* '''Link Limit''': 10 outbound + 10 inbound per expansion
* '''Traversal Depth''': 2 degrees from root (configurable)
* '''Node Limit''': Unlimited (browser memory dependent)

=== Customization ===
To change the root article, modify line 188 in <code>index.html</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
this.startArticle = "Your_Article_Title";
</syntaxhighlight>

== Console Logging ==

The application provides detailed console output:
* üöÄ Initialization status
* üìñ Articles being processed
* üîç Links discovered and extracted
* ‚ûï Nodes being added to graph
* üîó Links being created
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing pages and errors
* üñ±Ô∏è User interactions

== Browser Compatibility ==

* '''Modern Browsers''': Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
* '''Requirements''': ES6+ support, SVG rendering
* '''Dependencies''': D3.js v7 (loaded via CDN)

== File Structure ==

<pre>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Complete single-file application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wiki-graph.html     # (Previous version)
</pre>

== Technical Details ==

=== API Endpoints Used ===
* '''Outbound Links''': <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=links</code>
* '''Inbound Links''': <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=backlinks</code>
* '''Page Validation''': <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=</code>
* '''Article Categories''': <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=categories</code>
* '''Backlink Count''': <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=backlinks&bllimit=max</code>

=== Data Flow ===
# Initialize with root article
# Fetch outbound + inbound links
# Validate page existence and fetch metadata
# Assess article quality (Vital/Featured/Good) and backlink count
# Add valid pages as nodes with priority scoring
# Create directional links
# Sort processing queue by priority (highest first)
# Update visual representation with quality-based styling
# Enable context menu interactions for all nodes

== Roadmap ==

=== 1. Wikipedia User Script ===
Create a Wikipedia user script that hardcore Wikipedians can install directly on Wikipedia pages to instantly visualize article networks without leaving the site.

'''Features:'''
* One-click graph generation from any Wikipedia article
* Seamless integration with Wikipedia's interface
* Customizable settings for power users
* Export capabilities for research and analysis

=== 2. Browser Extensions ===
Develop browser extensions for easy installation by non-technical users across all major browsers:

* '''Chrome Extension''': Available on Chrome Web Store
* '''Firefox Extension''': Available on Mozilla Add-ons
* '''Edge Extension''': Available on Microsoft Edge Add-ons
* '''Safari Extension''': Available on Mac App Store
* '''DuckDuckGo Extension''': Privacy-focused browsing integration

'''Benefits:'''
* No technical setup required
* Automatic updates
* One-click installation
* Cross-browser compatibility

=== 3. Performance Optimization with Caching ===
Implement intelligent caching system to dramatically improve performance and reduce Wikipedia API load.

'''Caching Strategy:'''
* Local storage for frequently accessed articles
* Session-based cache for current browsing session
* Intelligent cache invalidation and updates
* Offline capability for previously loaded graphs

'''Performance Improvements:'''
* Faster graph loading times
* Reduced API calls to Wikipedia
* Better user experience with instant results
* Bandwidth optimization for mobile users

== Future Enhancements ==

* '''Search Functionality''': Custom root article selection ‚úÖ (Completed)
* '''Priority-Based Crawling''': Vital/Featured/Good articles first ‚úÖ (Completed)
* '''Context Menu System''': Multi-option node interactions ‚úÖ (Completed)
* '''Export Options''': Save graph as image or data
* '''Filtering''': Hide/show specific link types or quality levels
* '''Clustering''': Group related articles by topic or quality
* '''Performance''': Virtual rendering for large graphs
* '''Mobile''': Touch-optimized interactions
